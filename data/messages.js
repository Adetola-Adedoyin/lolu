      title: "Perfect",

    lyrics: `Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a lover, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own`,
    letter: `Abike mi, there's a dream I want to fulfill for you. Remember the song you wished to dance to with your husband at your wedding? I plan to make that dream a reality. Dancing with you, my love, in front of your parents, will be an honor.

Just like the song says, our happily ever after starts with our wedding. I can't wait to raise a family with you, creating a little village filled with your laughter. I yearn to be the best husband a woman could ask for, and that woman is you, at any age.

Age is just a number, and my love for you is boundless. Perhaps we'll surprise everyone with wedding invitations, or maybe I'll show up at your doorstep with my family, ready to claim my bride.

Marriage can't come soon enough. Imagine waking up with you every morning, instead of waiting for texts. Picture me picking you up from work, and carrying you home like a queen. I dream of lazy mornings, duvet days, and calling in sick just to be with you. Sharing our days, showing you funny videos, and letting you have my phone - it all excites me.

Cuddling close, road trips with music filling the air, and even shared baths - these are some of the things I dream of with you. Our love story will be a tapestry woven with shared experiences, big and small.

Abike mi, I can't wait to start forever with you by my side.`

    song: {
      title: "All That Really Matters",
      artist: "Illenium",
      filename: "audio/all-that-matters-illenium.mp3"
    },
    lyrics: `Find something you can hold on to
Find someone you can come home to
Cause that's all that really matters
Find someone who can die for you`,
    letter: `Baby, from the moment that song touched my ears, you filled my thoughts. You're the sun in my sky, the reason my world makes sense. I spend hours dreaming of our future together, all the adventures we'll share, about all we can accomplish, side by side. Imagine this: a remote project with a fancy launch party, a plus-one invitation. Who would I choose? No contest, it would always be you, Jesutomiloluwa. You are the missing piece, the one who makes everything complete.

Maybe some might find it crazy, picking you before we're officially married. But my heart knows its truth. I chose you, and with every beat, that choice echoes. 

There's a magic about you, Abike, a captivating force I wouldn't trade for anything. 

Please don't fall in love with someone else, because I really do love you. I want to be the one who makes you smile, the one who holds your hand through life's journey. I want to be the person you turn to when you need comfort, laughter, or just someone to share your day with.

I promise to cherish you, to support you in all your dreams, and to be there for you in every moment. You are my heart's desire, and I can't wait to build a life filled with love and happiness together.

So here's to us, Jesutomiloluwa Ayorinde. Here's to our future, our love story, and all the beautiful moments that await us.`
